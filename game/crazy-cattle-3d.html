            <h1>Crazy Cattle 3D - Game Guide</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Crazy Cattle 3D</strong> is a fast-paced battle royale game where players control a herd of wild cattle, using physical collisions to defeat enemies while avoiding being knocked over by other players. The goal is to be the last player standing.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
            <h4>Basic Controls:</h4>
            <p>
                - Use the arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) or WASD keys to control the direction of your herd.<br>
                - Adjust direction and speed to maneuver your herd flexibly across the battlefield.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Objective:</h4>
            <p>
                - Collide with other players’ herds to knock them over or trigger explosions.<br>
                - Avoid being hit by other players or crashing into obstacles.<br>
                - Be the last player standing to win the match.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Balance Mechanism:</h4>
            <p>
                - When your herd is about to be knocked over, quickly adjust the arrow keys or WASD keys to regain balance and avoid elimination.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Explosion Mechanism:</h4>
            <p>
                - Defeated enemies trigger an explosion that may affect nearby players.<br>
                - Keep your distance to avoid being caught in the blast.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Operation Tips</h3>
            <h4>Flexible Movement:</h4>
            <p>
                - Keep your herd moving smoothly to avoid becoming a stationary target.<br>
                - Use small directional adjustments to dodge enemy collisions.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Leverage Speed:</h4>
            <p>
                - Ensure sufficient speed and impact force when colliding with enemies to increase your chances of defeating them.<br>
                - Use speed-boost items (if available) to quickly approach enemies or escape dangerous areas.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Battlefield Awareness:</h4>
            <p>
                - Always monitor the positions of other players to avoid being ganged up on.<br>
                - Use obstacles as cover to temporarily evade enemy pursuits.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Maintain Distance:</h4>
            <p>
                - When an enemy is defeated, quickly move away from the explosion area to avoid taking damage.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Strategic Advice</h3>
            <h4>Prioritize Weaker Targets:</h4>
            <p>
                - Focus on attacking players who are about to be knocked over or are in vulnerable positions to quickly reduce the number of competitors.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Utilize Terrain:</h4>
            <p>
                - Use map obstacles (e.g., fences, rocks) to block enemy attacks.<br>
                - Lure enemies into narrow areas to increase their chances of making mistakes.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Stay Patient:</h4>
            <p>
                - Avoid rushing into attacks; wait for enemies to make errors or weaken each other before striking.<br>
                - Stay calm on the battlefield to avoid reckless actions that could lead to elimination.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Master Balance Techniques:</h4>
            <p>
                - When about to be knocked over, quickly adjust the direction keys to regain balance and avoid elimination.<br>
                - Practice balance techniques to significantly improve your survivability.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
            <h4>Feints:</h4>
            <p>
                - Pretend to move in one direction to trick enemies into hitting obstacles or entering disadvantageous positions.<br>
                - Suddenly change direction to catch enemies off guard with a surprise collision.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Ganging-Up Strategy:</h4>
            <p>
                - If the opportunity arises, temporarily team up with other players to take down stronger opponents.<br>
                - After the gank, quickly adapt your strategy to avoid being counterattacked.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Time Management:</h4>
            <p>
                - In the late stages of the match, the battlefield becomes more intense; manage your energy and time wisely.<br>
                - Seize final opportunities to defeat remaining opponents and secure victory.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Common Issues and Solutions</h3>
            <h4>How to Avoid Being Knocked Over?</h4>
            <p>
                - Keep moving to avoid staying in one place.<br>
                - When hit, quickly adjust the direction keys to regain balance.
            </p>
        
            <h4>How to Handle Multiple Enemies?</h4>
            <p>
                - Use terrain and obstacles to distract enemies.<br>
                - Prioritize defeating the closest enemy to gradually reduce threats.
            </p>
        
            <h4>How to Improve Collision Success Rate?</h4>
            <p>
                - Ensure sufficient speed and angle, aiming for the enemy’s side or rear.<br>
                - Avoid head-on collisions with stronger opponents.
