        <h2>Bloxorz</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Bloxorz</strong> is a classic 3D puzzle game that has captivated millions of players since its release in 2007. Your mission is simple yet challenging: guide a rectangular block through intricate mazes and drop it into a square hole at the end of each level. With clever mechanics like switches, fragile tiles, and teleports, Bloxorz offers a perfect blend of strategy, logic, and fun. Are you ready to test your spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills?
        </p>
        <h3>How to Play Bloxorz</h3>
        <p>
            - **Move the Block:** Use the arrow keys (or on-screen buttons for mobile) to tilt and flip the block across the platforms.<br>
            - **Avoid Falling:** Ensure your block doesn’t fall off the edge of the platform.<br>
            - **Fragile Tiles:** Be cautious of orange tiles—they will crumble if your block stands on them vertically.<br>
            - **Activate Switches:** Stand on switches to open or close bridges. X-shaped switches require the block to stand vertically, while round switches can be activated in any position.<br>
            - **Use Teleports:** Some tiles split your block into two cubes and teleport one of them to a different location. Use the spacebar (or toggle button) to control each cube individually and reconnect them.<br>
            - **Reach the Goal:** Navigate the block to the square hole at the end of each level to progress.<br>
        </p>
